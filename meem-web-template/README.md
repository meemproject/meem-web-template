# Meem Project Web Template -

## About

This template project serves as a starting point for a NextJS dDapp built on top of the Meem protocol. It contains our API library and React components that you can use to connect a wallet, authenticate with Meem and start building.

This template project is deliberately agnostic in regards to UI components, but does include some opinionated ESLint rules and other defaults that we have found to be helpful.

## Installation

`yarn`

`yarn local`
